# Personally Identifiable Information<a name="macie-classify-objects-pii"></a>

Object classification by personally identifiable information \(PII\) is based on recognizing any personally identifiable artifacts based on industry standards such as NIST\-80\-122 and FIPS 199\. Macie Classic can recognize the following PII artifacts: 
+ Full names
+ Mailing addresses
+ Email addresses
